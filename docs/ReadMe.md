# Optimizing Petrol Distribution and Management using Decentralized Multi-Agent-Oriented Programming.

## Project Overview: 
Petrol distribution and management is a complex and challenging task, especially in countries where petrol is a scarce resource. The traditional centralized approach to petrol distribution has limitations that can result in inefficiencies, such as petrol shortages, long waiting times, and uneven distribution. To overcome these challenges, a decentralized multi-agent-oriented programming approach can be used to optimize the petrol distribution process.

Overall, this project aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of a decentralized multi-agent-oriented programming approach in optimizing the petrol distribution process. To achieve the goal, I will demonstrate a decentralized multi-agent-oriented programming approach, and compare its results with centralized approach to highlight their respective outcomes.
