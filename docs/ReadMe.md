# Optimizing Petrol Distribution and Management using Decentralized Multi-Agent-Oriented Programming.

## Project Overview: Developed a decentralized multi-agent system to optimize petrol distribution in resource-scarce environments. This approach reduced inefficiencies like shortages and long waiting times. The project demonstrated superior efficiency over traditional centralized methods, ensuring timely and even petrol supply to meet consumer demands.
